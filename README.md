The personal branding and website of Alexis Gervacio!<br>
[Click here to be amazed.](https://avacio.github.io/) (Or at least, pleasantly surprised.)

## Logo
![Alt text](https://i.imgur.com/qwns5Sm.png) <br>
Displaying a shuffle icon, my logo represents my life motto to constantly change it up! <br>
There is so much already out there in the world, but that doesn't mean that everything is perfect and should stay static. Reality is dynamic, and I aim to add my own flavour to things, adapting and changing as the world around us evolves as well. Also, the shuffle icon looks like an X, which is kind of my thing, since I have one in my name.
<br><br>
My signature colour is **#b34d49**: a bold and daring red, but still flat enough to be classy. (I'd like to think this extends to my personality, as well.)


## Name
I suppose the name **"avacio"** may seem nonsensical at first, but when I was scrounging my brain for any possible cool and funny and relevant usernames, my friend just laid it down, clean and simple. <br>
**A**~~LEXIS~~ ~~GER~~**VACIO** <br>
I don't know about you, but I think it looks sweet.

## Opening Animation
Using Adobe AfterEffects, I created my own opening animations to introduce new visitors to my site. <br>

The first one is the tracing of a path through many of my personal interests. Like a treasure map, it eventually terminates with an "X" that marks the spot.
Coincidentally, the shape resembles that of Canada... or a giant blob, depending on your perspective. After an iteration of this long GIF, I use Javascript to loop the second GIF of a pulsing X.

## Website
The rest of my website is the result of *many* hours of blood, sweat, and tears. Also debugging. Lots of debugging. I've also made pages for an About section, and a Music section, but I expect that this website will grow as time goes on.
