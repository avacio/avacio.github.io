The personal branding and website of Alexis Gervacio!<br>
[Click here to be amazed.](https://avacio.github.io/) (Or at least, pleasantly surprised.)

## Logo
![Alt text](https://i.imgur.com/qwns5Sm.png) <br>
Displaying a shuffle icon, my logo represents my life motto to constantly change it up! <br>
There is so much already out there in the world, but that doesn't mean that everything is perfect and should stay static. Reality is dynamic, and I aim to add my own flavour to things, adapting and changing as the world around us evolves as well. Also, the shuffle icon looks like an X, which is kind of my thing, since I have one in my name.
<br><br>
My signature colour is **#b34d49**: a bold and daring red, but still flat enough to be classy. (I'd like to think this extends to my personality, as well.)


## Name
I suppose the name **"avacio"** may seem nonsensical at first, but when I was scrounging my brain for any possible cool and funny and relevant usernames, my friend just laid it down, clean and simple. <br>
**A**~~LEXIS~~ ~~GER~~**VACIO** <br>
I don't know about you, but I think it looks sweet.

<br><br>
## Opening Animation
Using Adobe AfterEffects, I created my own opening animations to introduce new visitors to my site. <br>

<br>
The first one is the tracing of a path through many of my personal interests. Like a treasure map, it eventually terminates with an "X" that marks the spot.
Coincidentally, the shape resembles that of Canada... or a giant blob, depending on your perspective. After an iteration of this long GIF, I use Javascript to loop the second GIF of a pulsing X.

<br><br>
## Website
The rest of my website is the result of *many* hours of blood, sweat, and tears. Also debugging. Lots of debugging. I've also made pages for an About section, and a Music section, but I expect that this website will grow as time goes on.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
